    description: 'Nino owns a pizza shop. He is very good at what he does. In one hour, he can make 9 pizzas or prepare 36 salads. His business is growing and he needs to hire someone to help prepare pizzas and salads. Tony has applied for the job and seems like a reliable individual. In one hour, Tony can make 6 pizzas or prepare 12 salads. Nino plans to hire Tony. Because Nino can make more pizzas in an hour and prepare more salads in an hour than Tony, he has a dilemma. Should he have Tony make pizzas or prepare salads?',
